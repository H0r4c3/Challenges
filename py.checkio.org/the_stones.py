'''
You most likely know the game where two players are in turn taking from a pile from 1 to 3 stones, and loses the one who took the last stone. We'll slightly generalize this task. Let's assume that both players can take not 1, 2, 3 stones, but k1, k2, â€¦, km of stones. Here we are interested which player wins under the right circumstances (the game played properly and both players use the best strategy).
As the input you will get the number of stones in the pile at the beginning of the game and an amounts of stones you can take from pile at each move. For example - (10, [1, 2, 3]).
If the current amount of the stones in the pile is lower than lowest number in the "moves" list or equal to it - current player takes them all and lose.
