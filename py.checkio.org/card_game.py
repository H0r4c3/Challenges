'''
In this mission will be used a special deck of double-sided cards which had the numbers written on them - one number per one side of the card. 
The numbers on the cards are written according to the following principle: the first card has 0 and 1, the second - 1 and 2, ..., the n-th - (n-1) and n. 
The cards in this set are shuffled chaotically.

As input your function receives the total number of cards and a list of numbers which have been seen on the alternately taken N cards, 
noting that you are looking only at the front side of the card. Your task is to determine whether the cards that youâ€™ve seen are a part of 
this set or the cards from some other deck have accidentally got mixed up. Depending on the answer, return True (if all the viewed cards can be 
encountered only within one deck) or False (if otherwise).
