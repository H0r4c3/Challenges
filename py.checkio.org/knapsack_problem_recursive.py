'''
This mission is dedicated to a famous and classical Knapsack Problem.

You are given a list of kinds of items that you want to put into knapsack. 
Item of each kind is a tuple of its value, weight and maximum amount (optional). 

You need to find a subset of items, such that:

- the total value of the items in subset is as large as possible;
- the total weight of items in subset is at most weight, that is capacity of the knapsack;
- for each kind of items you can select at most given amount items. If its not given - there is no restriction for amount.

# Knapsack brute-force recursion 
# The most obvious solution to this problem is brute force recursive. 
# This solution is brute-force because it evaluates the total weight and value of all possible subsets, 
# then selects the subset with the highest value that is still under the weight limit.

'''
Hereâ€™s a pseudo code explanation of how this program functions.

for each item 'i' starting from the end
  create a new set which INCLUDES item 'i' if the total weight does not exceed the capacity, and recursively process the remaining capacity and items
  create a new set WITHOUT item 'i', and recursively process the remaining items 
 
return the set from the above two sets with higher profit
