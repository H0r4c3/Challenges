'''
You are planning the train schedule and you want to know the minimum time of traveling between the stations.

Starting speed is 0.
Speed limit is set for each section of the rail. You don't exceed it.
You must reach the target station at speed 1 (because itâ€™s necessary to stop at the station).
You should return the minimum time (minutes) as an integer.
