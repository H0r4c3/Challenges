'''
We have some horse racing statistics (each horseâ€™s time in each race)
You have to find the number of the horse which has the most wins.

Input: Racing time as an array of arrays.

Output: The number of the fastest horse that has the most wins (Important: in this task the horse numbers starts from "1", not from "0")
