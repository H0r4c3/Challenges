'''
You should write a function that will receive a positive integer and return:
"Fizz Buzz" if the number is divisible by 3 and by 5;
"Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3;
"Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5;
The number as a string for other cases.
Input: A number as an integer.

Output: The answer as a string.

# Some hints:
# Convert a number in the string with str(n)

# These "asserts" using only for self-checking and not necessary for auto-testing
