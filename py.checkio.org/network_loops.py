'''
A routing loop is a common problem with computer networks. Loops are virtually the same as cycles in graphs. 
For this mission, weâ€™ll learn how to find these cycles in a network.

A cycle consists of a sequence of nodes starting and ending on the same node without repetition and 
with each consecutive node in the sequence connecting to each other in the network. The cycle length is the quantity of nodes within the cycle. 
The length of cycle will always be greater than 2. 
You should find the largest cycle in a given network, determine if we have multiple equal sized loops, then choose any one of them.
