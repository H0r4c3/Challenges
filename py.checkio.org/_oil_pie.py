'''
There are 6 drones. The first group consists of 2 drones. They had divided the pie into 6 parts and took 2/6 of the pie. 
The remainder of the pie is 2/3 of the entire pie. Next returns a single drone, it doesnâ€™t know about the original size of the pie, 
so it divides the remaining pie into 6 slices and takes 1 part. This leaves 10/18=5/9. The last group is 3 drones, which heard about 
the original size of the pie from Sophia. They took half of the original pie, so the remaining is 5/9 - 3/6 = 1/18

You are given an ordered array with sizes of the groups in the order they arrived. If a group knows about the initial pie size, then the size is positive. 
If not, then size will be negative. The recent example will given as (2, -1, 3).
