'''
There are N trees in a circle. Each tree has a fruit value associated with it. 
A bird has to sit on a tree for 0.5 sec to gather all the fruits present on the tree and then the bird can move to a neighboring tree. 
It takes the bird 0.5 seconds to move from one tree to another. 
Once all the fruits are picked from a particular tree, she canâ€™t pick any more fruits from that tree. The maximum number of fruits she can gather is infinite.

Input:
N=7 M=3
arr[] = { 2 ,1 ,3 ,5 ,0 ,1 ,4 }
Output: 9
Explanation: 
She can start from tree 1 and move
to tree2 and then to tree 3.
Hence, total number of gathered fruits
= 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.
